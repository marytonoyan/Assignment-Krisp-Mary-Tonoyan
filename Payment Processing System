# Payment Processing System

This repository demonstrates how to generate, store, and handle payment data.

```python

def payment_generator():
    payments = list()
   
def callback_fn(amount):
    payments.append(amount)
   
    stream_payments(callback_fn)
   
    while payments:
        yield payments.pop(0)

def process_payments_2():
    payments_gen = payment_generator()

    store_payments(payments_gen)


process_payments_2()
